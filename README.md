Focus Flow App
An app that detects fatigue and tiredness through eye strain, slouching, twitching, and more and detects and tracks focus and tab usage on the desktop to prioritize productivity.

Install the application and run its setup.py file to generate the installable file on your system or main.py to see how it works. The application is not connected to the internet but only to your PC's background. You can exit it or pause it whenever you want.
